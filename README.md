# Personal Food Tracker App

## Overview
A web application designed to help users track their daily food intake, manage meals, and monitor nutritional data. The app allows users to:

- Add foods to the database.
- Organize foods into meals, which can also be saved in the database.
- Add foods or meals to the list of current foods for the day.
- View the total nutritional breakdown (macros) for the foods consumed.

## Notes

This is a simple app where both the frontend and backend are integrated into a single project.

- `server.js`: Will manage the static file serving and database management

### Server
- `database.js`:
- `foods.db`: 
Everything else is for the client

### TODOs
- Add a "Clear All" option to reset the current day's food intake.
